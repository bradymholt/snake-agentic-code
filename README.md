# snake-llm

This repo combines three HTML-based Snake game variants generated by different LLMs.

## Directory layout

- `codex/` - generated by Codex (`snake-codex/index.html` source)
- `claude/` - generated by Claude (`snake-claude/snake.html` source, renamed to `index.html`)
- `gemini/` - generated by Gemini (`snake-gemini/index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js` source)
- `index.html` - landing page with links to each playable version

## How each version was generated

The three game folders in `../` appear to be independently generated outputs:

1. Codex: produced as a single-file implementation in `snake-codex/index.html`.
2. Claude: produced as a single-file implementation in `snake-claude/snake.html`.
3. Gemini: produced as a three-file implementation in `snake-gemini/`.

This project copies those outputs into one repo structure so they can be hosted together.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the folder with a static server.

## GitHub Pages deployment

This repo includes `.github/workflows/pages.yml` to deploy automatically on pushes to `main`.

### One-time GitHub setup

1. Create a new GitHub repository (for example `snake-llm`).
2. Push this folder to the `main` branch.
3. In GitHub: `Settings -> Pages -> Build and deployment`, set `Source` to **GitHub Actions**.

After that, each push to `main` publishes the site.
